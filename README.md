# Image-Classification-and-Dimension-Reduction via PCA

Thank you for visiting. The project consits of Image Classification using Font data. Supervised algorithms KNN and RandomForest were used to classify font images. PCA was performed for dimension reduction. Lastly, Unsupervised K-means algorithm was used to visualize centers and for comparative analysis with supervised KNN algorithm.
