# Image-Classification-and-Dimension-Reduction via PCA

Thank you for visiting. The project consits of Image Classification using Font data. The project consists of four parts.
1) Supervised algorithm KNN for image classification analysis (Completed)
2) Supervised algorithm RandomForest for image classification analysis (Completed)
3) PCA was performed for dimension reduction using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. (Completed)
4) Unsupervised K-means algorithm was used to visualize centers and for comparative analysis with supervised KNN algorithm. (In Progress- Will be updated soon)
